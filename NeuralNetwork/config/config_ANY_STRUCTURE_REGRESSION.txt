[MODEL]
# layers is a comma-separated list of integers telling us how many nodes in each
# hidden layer. Special case: If the value is only one element in the list, and
# its value is 0, you should generate a net without a hidden layer
layers = 10, 10, 10

# activations is a comma-separated list of key-words. It will have as many
# elements as there are elements in the layers-list. Each keyword is a
# non-linearity function, and legal values are relu, linear, and tanh.
activations = relu, relu, relu

# loss_type chooses between L2 loss (for regression) and
# cross_entropy (for classification).
loss_type = cross_entropy

# Learning rate to use
